        <dt>Andrew Garfield</dt>
            <dd>Andrew Russell Garfield was born on 20 August 1983, in Los Angeles, California.[5] His mother, Lynn (née Hillman),[6] was from Essex, England, and his father, Richard Garfield, is from California.[7][8] Richard's parents were also from the United Kingdom.[9] Garfield's parents moved the family from the United States to the United Kingdom when he was three years old, and he was brought up in Epsom, Surrey.[7][10][11][12]

            He is Jewish on his father's side, and describes himself as a "Jewish artist".[13][14][15][16] His paternal grandparents were from Jewish immigrant families who moved to London from Poland, Russia, and Romania, and the family surname was originally "Garfinkel".[9][17][18] In April 2025, Garfield participated in the British TV show Who Do You Think You Are?[19] He uncovered his Jewish roots in Kielce, Poland, and also found that a great-great aunt, Ruchla Garfinkiel, married the first cousin of Władysław Szpilman, the subject of the 2002 film The Pianist.[20]

            Garfield's parents ran a small interior-design business. His mother was also a teaching assistant at a nursery school, and his father became head coach of the Guildford City Swimming Club.[21][22] He has an older brother who is an NHS doctor at Royal Brompton Hospital.[23][24] Garfield was a gymnast and a swimmer during his early years.[8][21] He had originally intended to study business, but became interested in acting at the age of 16 when a friend convinced him to take theatre studies at A-level, as they were one pupil short of being able to run the class.[25][26] Garfield attended Priory Preparatory School in Banstead and later City of London Freemen's School in Ashtead, before training at the Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London.[27][21][28] His first job was at Starbucks, being moved between three separate establishments in Golders Green and Hendon.[29][30]</dd>
